SimpleFIN (also SFIN) stands for Simple Financial Interchange and makes read-only financial interchange simple. It's like RSS for financial information.

SimpleFIN is like a window on a safe: it lets people look at, but not touch your financial information. And you control who can look through the window!

You should use SimpleFIN because:

- All access is read-only.
- You can read and comprehend the spec in a single day.
- Banks don't have to pay anyone to use it (like they do with QFX).
- Ubiquitous use will help train people that giving out their account credentials is unacceptable.
